  As $m_{\prd}$ approaches
  $-\Min{m}_{\prd}$, $\Min{\koppa}_{\prd}(\mu_{\prd})$ converges to zero, while as $m_{\prd}$
  approaches $+\infty$, $\Min{\koppa}_{\prd}(\mu_{\prd})$ approaches $1$.

  As before, we can derive an approximated consumption function; call it $\Aprx{\Min{\cFunc}}_{\prd}$.  This function will clearly do a better job approximating the consumption function for low values of $\mNrm_{\prd}$ while the previous approximation will perform better for high values of $\mNrm_{\prd}$.

  For middling values of $\mNrm$ it is not clear which of these functions will perform better.  However, an alternative is available which performs well.  Define the highest gridpoint below $\mtCusp$ as $\bar{\check{\mNrm}}_{\prd}^{\#}$ and the lowest gridpoint above $\mtCusp$ as $\Min{\hat{\mNrm}}_{\prd}^{\#}$.  Then there will be a unique interpolating polynomial that matches the level and slope of the consumption function at these two points.  Call this function $\tilde{\cFunc}_{\prd}(\mNrm)$.

  Using indicator functions that are zero everywhere except for specified intervals,
