  \noindent  where the fraction in the middle of the last inequality is the ratio
  of actual precautionary saving (the numerator is the difference
  between perfect-foresight consumption and optimal consumption in the
  presence of uncertainty) to the maximum conceivable amount of
  precautionary saving (the amount that would be undertaken by the
  pessimist who consumes nothing out of any future income beyond the perfectly certain component).
