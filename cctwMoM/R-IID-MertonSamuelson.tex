\begin{equation}\begin{gathered}\begin{aligned}
  \MPC  & = 1- \left(\Discount  \Ex_{t}[\Risky_{t+1}^{1-\CRRA}]\right)^{1/\CRRA} \label{eq:MPCExact}
\end{aligned}\end{gathered}\end{equation}
and in this case the previous analysis applies once we substitute this MPC for the one that characterizes
the perfect foresight problem without rate-of-return risk.
