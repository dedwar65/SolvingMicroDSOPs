  As a preliminary to our solution, define $\hNrm_{\EndStp}$ as end-of-period human wealth (the present discounted value of future labor income) for a perfect foresight version of the problem of a `risk optimist:' a period-$t$ consumer who believes with perfect confidence that the shocks will always take their expected value of \PermShkOn {1, $\TranShkEmp_{\prd+n} = \Ex[\TranShkEmp]=1~\forall~n>0$ and $\PermShk_{\prd+n} = \Ex[\PermShk]=1~\forall~n>0$.}  {1, $\TranShkEmp_{\prd+n} = \Ex[\TranShkEmp]=1~\forall~n>0$.}  The solution to a perfect foresight problem of this kind takes the form\footnote{For a derivation, see \cite{BufferStockTheory}; $\MPCmin_{\prd}$ is defined therein as the MPC of the perfect foresight consumer with horizon $\prdT-\prdt$.}
