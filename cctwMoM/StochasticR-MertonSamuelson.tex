This case is reasonably straightforward because \cite{merton:restat} and \cite{samuelson:portfolio} showed
that for a consumer without labor income (or with perfectly forecastable labor income) the consumption
function is linear, with a MPC\footnote{See \handoutC{CRRA-RateRisk} for a derivation.}
\begin{eqnarray}
  \MPC & = & 1- \left(\Discount  \Ex_{t}[\Risky_{t+1}^{1-\CRRA}]\right)^{1/\CRRA} \label{eq:MPCExact}
\end{eqnarray}
and in this case the previous analysis applies once we substitute this MPC for the one that characterizes
the perfect foresight problem without rate-of-return risk.
