  Often it is useful to know the value function as well as the consumption rule.  Fortunately, many of the tricks used when solving for the consumption rule have a direct analogue in approximation of the value function.

  Consider the perfect foresight (or ``optimist's'') problem in period $\trmT-1$.  Using the fact that in a perfect foresight model the growth factor for consumption is $(\Rfree \DiscFac)^{1/\CRRA}$, we can use the fact that $\cNrm_{\prd} = (\Rfree \DiscFac)^{1/\CRRA} \cNrm_{\prd-1}$ to calculate the value function in period $\trmT-1$:
  \begin{equation*}\begin{gathered}\begin{aligned}
        \bar{\vFunc}_{\prd-1}({m}_{\prd-1})  & \equiv  \uFunc(\cNrm_{\prd-1})+\DiscFac \uFunc(\cNrm_{\prd})
        \\  & = \uFunc(\cNrm_{\prd-1})\left(1+\DiscFac ((\DiscFac\Rfree)^{1/\CRRA})^{1-\CRRA}\right)
        % \\  & = \uFunc(\cNrm_{\prd-1})\left(1+\DiscFac (\DiscFac\Rfree)^{1/\CRRA-1}\right)
        \\  & = \uFunc(\cNrm_{\prd-1})\left(1+(\DiscFac\Rfree)^{1/\CRRA}/\Rfree\right)
        \\  & = \uFunc(\cNrm_{\prd-1})\underbrace{\mbox{PDV}_{\prd}^{T}(\cNrm)/\cNrm_{\prd-1}}_{\equiv \PDVCoverc_{\prd-1}^{T}}
      \end{aligned}\end{gathered}\end{equation*}
  where $\PDVCoverc_{\prd}^{T}=\mbox{PDV}_{\prd}^{T}(\cNrm)$ is the present discounted value of consumption, normalized by current consumption. Using the fact demonstrated in \cite{BufferStockTheory} that $\PDVCoverc_{\prd}=\MPC^{-1}_{\prd}$, a similar function can be constructed recursively for earlier periods, yielding the general expression \hypertarget{vFuncPF}{}
